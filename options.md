**Enforcing options**

{% include enforcers.html %}

**Relaxing options**

{% include relaxers.html %}

**Environments**

These options pre-define global variables that are exposed by popular JavaScript
libraries and runtime environmentsâ€”such as browser or Node. Essentially they are
shortcuts for explicit declarations like `/*global $:false, jQuery:false */`.

{% include environments.html %}

**Legacy**

These options are legacy from JSLint. Aside from bug fixes they will not be
improved in any way and might be removed at any point.
