This release adds **new checks for excessive code**! You can now use JSHint
to check number of parameters per function, nested block depth per function,
number of statements per function and function's cyclomatic complexity.
More information in our [docs](/docs/) or in this brilliant
[patch](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/pull/593/).

Other changes:

* Fixed bugs where JSHint couldn't parse Number.NaN and ES5 sparse arrays.
* Fixed bugs where JSHint couldn't parse some confusing regular expressions.
* `catch` blocks now has their own scope so if you define a function within
  a catch block and try to use it outside of said blockâ€”JSHint will warn you
    about undefined variable. JSHint also warns about cases when the catch
    scope leaks values into the outer scope in IE:

      var e = 2;

      try {
        throw 'boom';
      } catch (e) {
        // JSHint: 'e' may get overwritten in IE.
      }

      console.log(e + 2); // 'boom2' instead of 4

* We no longer warn when Object is used as a function. Like Boolean, Number
  and String, Object can be called as a function which provides scripts with
    access to ECMAScript's internal ToObject logic.
* We no longer warn when uncapitalized global functions are used as constructors.
* JSHint now recognizes some ES6 globals (Map, Set and WeakMap) and one
  additional browser global Blob.
* Updated our list of globals for MooTools.
* JSHint can now check code within simple eval strings. For example, JSHint can
  now spot typos like this one (this practice is still discouraged, though):

      eval("oops("); // Expected ')' and instead saw ''.

* \+ other minor bugfixes.
