This release introduces a new optionâ€”`quotmark`. This option allows
you to enforce the consistency of quotation marks.

Other changes:

* New globals for the WebWorker API.

* New globals for the `browser` option.

* New option `camelcase`. If set to true, all identifiers are required
  to be either in camelCase or UPPER_CASE with underscores.

* \+ bugfixes.
