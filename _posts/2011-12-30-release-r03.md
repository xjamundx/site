This release contains significant improvements to the way JSHint
treats ES5 accessor functions:

* Getters no longer raise the “Don't make functions within a loop”
  warnings.

* JSHint no longer enforces `value` as a parameter name for setter
  functions.

* JSHint no longer requires setter functions to follow getters.

* Improved checks for duplicate properties. For example, JSHint now
  understands that this code is valid:

        x = {
              get x: function () {},
                set x: function () {}
            };

    While this one is not:

        x = {
              get x: function () {},
                x: true
            };

* Tests cover more use cases with ES5 accessors.

* Fixed a bug with JSHint producing false warning for the following
  code:

        somevar.replace(/[0-9-]/g, "");

Thanks to Máté Farkas and Wolfgang Kluge.

#### Welcome Wolfgang and Josh!
