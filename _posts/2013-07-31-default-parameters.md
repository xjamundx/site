Yesterday, I decided to post a bounty on [a feature request](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/1195) to add support
for ES6 [parameter default values](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:parameter_default_values).
I put $50 and a few minutes later the bounty was increased to $150. Then I sent out this tweet and
went to grab some food:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>if you want $150 for a couple of hours of open source hacking, add support for default params to <a href="https://twitter.com/JSHint">@jshint</a>: <a href="https://t.co/ZnJG7G2a1X">https://t.co/ZnJG7G2a1X</a></p>&mdash; Anton (@valueof) <a href="https://twitter.com/valueof/statuses/362361275583442945">July 30, 2013</a></blockquote>

**One hour later** an incredible [Thomas Boyt](https://twitter.com/thomasABoyt)
posted his solution which I reviewed, landed and published today as JSHint 2.1.8.
This means that JSHint now officially supports default parameters!
