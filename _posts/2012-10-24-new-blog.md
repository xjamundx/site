Welcome to the official JSHint blog. This blog will serve two purposes.
First, it will replace our old Changelog page where we announce new JSHint
releases. Second, I will use this blog as a platform to share stuff about
static code analysis I find interesting.

For example, Ariya Hidayat (of Esprima and PhantomJS) gave what seems to
be a very nice talk a few days ago at the EmpireJS. His slides are embedded
below.

<div id="ariya-empirejs">
</div>

<script>
(function () {
var st = document.createElement("script");
st.async = true;
st.className = "speakerdeck-embed";
st.src = "//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js";
st.setAttribute("data-id", "50857786ae6235000200483e");
st.setAttribute("data-ratio", "1.299492385786802");
document.getElementById("ariya-empirejs").appendChild(st);
})();
</script>

Oh and check out [jshint.com](http://jshint.com/), it has a cool new header.
