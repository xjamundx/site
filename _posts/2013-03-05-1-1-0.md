JSHint 1.1.0 is out! This release contains important bug fixes for 1.0.0 and a
couple of new features.

* This version adds a new environment option for PhantomJS: `phantom`.
  ([#814](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/814))
* Fixes a bug where JSHint would skip parent directory when looking for
  `.jshintrc` file. ([#850](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/850))
* Adds new option `gcl` to make JSHint style checks compatible with Google
  Closure Linter.
  ([#812](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/812) and
  [#811](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/811))
* Adds a new example `.jshintrc` file that mirrors defaults from the website.
* Removes errors about empty input. JSHint will now treat empty files as valid.
  ([#767](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/767))
* Fixes a bug where code like `return "=";` would produce a false positive
  warning. ([#878](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/878))
* Expands on the configurability of `unused`. This option now accepts the
  following values:
  * `false`: no checking is done.
  * `true`: checks all variables and parameters, unless unused parameter is
    followed by a used one:

        function test(err, val) {
          return val;
        }
  * `"vars"`: checks only variables but not function parameters.
  * `"strict"`: checks all variables and all function parameters.
  ([#778](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/778))
* Fixes a bug where `\0` in strings would produce a false positive warning.
* Fixes a bug where `unused` would generate false positive warnings on ES3
  future reserved words in the ES5 environment.
* Removes support for all single-line special comments except for `// jshint`.

I would also like to use this moment to say hi to my friends and family, and
remind everyone that we're running [a fundraising campaign on BountySource](https://www.bountysource.com/#fundraisers/91-jshint). All money
donated will be used to pay contributors for fixing bugs and shipping new
features. So if you like JSHint donate today. And if you hate JSHint donate
tomorrow.
