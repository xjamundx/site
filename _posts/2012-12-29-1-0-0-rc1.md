**UPDATE:** [JSHint 1.0.0 RC3](http://jshint.com/blog/2013-01-01/1-0-0-rc3/).

---

After three months and 100+ commits, JSHint 1.0.0 is ready for release.
This is the biggest release for JSHint so far, and that's why I've decided to run it
through a release candidate phase first. I tried my best to make it as
backwards compatible as possible, but there might be a small number of
incompatibilities depending on how you use JSHint. Please keep that in mind
and test your integration before updating to 1.0.0.

One of the biggest changes is that node-jshint is now part of the main JSHint
project, which means that there will no longer be lag time between releasing a
new version and publishing it on NPM. **Node and NPM is now the main and
recommended way of using JSHint on all platforms.** This also means that
starting with "1.0.0", JSHint will start using the
[node-semver](https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver) versioning system instead
of the old rN system.

In addition, this version drops support for non-ES5 environments. This means that
JavaScript engines that don't support the ES5 syntax will not even parse
JSHint's source code. (For example, the online interface for JSHint will not
work in older versions of IE.)

I'm very excited to finally release this version and I encourage everyone to try
out the release candidate and report any bugs and issues you encounter. The full
changelog is provided below, with examples and links to relevant issues.

#### Parser

This version has a completely rewritten lexer. Since it's no longer a giant
regexp, the new lexer is more robust and easier to read. I'd like to thank the
authors of Esprima and Traceur since I borrowed some pieces from them.

* This version **adds support for Unicode identifiers!**
  ([#301](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/301) and
  [#716](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/716/))

      var Ï€ = 3.1415;

* Adds support for the comma operator. ([#56](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/56/))
  JSHint now parses code like the following (note the comma in the middle
  expression):

      for (var i = 0, ch; ch = channels[i], i < channels.length; i++) {
        // ...
      }

* Improves support for numbers. JSHint now understands numbers with leading dots
  (e.g. .12) and doesn't generate false positives on invalid numbers (e.g. 099).
  In case of invalid numbers the parser still parses them but marks as
  malformed and generates a nice little warning.

* Adds support for more relaxed JSHint directive syntax. JSHint now recognizes
  space between `/*` and jshint/global/etc. and allows you to use single-line
  comments for directives in addition to multi-line comments:

      Before:
      /*jshint strict:true */

      Now:
      /*jshint strict:true */
      /* jshint strict:true */ (note the space)
      //jshint strict:true
      // jshint strict:true

  One potentially breaking change is that all lists inside JSHint directives
  must be separated by commas from now on. So `/*jshint strict:true undef:true */`
  won't fly anymore but `/*jshint strict:true, undef:true */` will (note the
  comma).

* Adds better parser for regular expressions. Previously, JSHint would check
  the  grammar of regular expressions using its own internal logic. Now, JSHint
  compiles the parsed expressions using the native RegExp object to check
  for grammar errors.

* Adds support for a defensive semicolon before `[`. (Ticket
  [#487](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/487/))

* Adds support for unclosed multi-line strings and removes warnings about
  unnecessary escaping for `\u` and `\x` in strings.
  ([#494](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/494/))

Bug fixes:

* Fixes a bug with JSHint not warning about reserved words being used as
  variable and function declaration identifiers. (Ticket
  [#744](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/744/))

* Fixes a bug with JSHint generating a false positive *Missing whitespace...*
  warning on trailing commas.
  ([#363](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/363/))

* Fixes a bug with JSHint not being able to parse regular expressions preceded
  by *typeof* (e.g. `typeof /[a-z]/`) and, in some cases, \*=, /=, etc.
  (e.g. `if (x /= 2) { ... }`).
  ([#657](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/657/))

#### General

* This version adds a unique numeric code to every warning and error message
  produced by JSHint. That means that you can now **ignore any warning**
  produced by JSHint even when there is no corresponding option for it. You can
  do that using the special minus (-) operator. For example, here's how you
  ignore all messages about trailing decimal points (W047):

      /*jshint -W047 */

  or

      JSHINT(src, { "-W047": true });

  Keep in mind that this syntax can't be used to ignore errors.

* Due to popular demand, this version splits *indent* and *white* options
  meaning that *indent* won't imply *white* anymore.
  ([#667](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/667/))

* Changes *node* option to not assume that all programs must be
  running in strict mode.
  ([#721](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/721/))

* Adds new globals for the *browser* option: Element and Uint8ClampedArray.
  ([#707](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/707/) and
  [#766](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/766/))

* Adds new global for the *node* option: DataView.
  ([#773](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/773/) and
  [#774](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/774/))

* Removes option *onecase*.

* **Adds new directive: exported**. Use `/* exported ... ` for global variables
  that are defined in the current file but used elsewhere to prevent
  unnecessary *X is defined but never used* warnings. As before, you need to declare those
  variables as global in the other files.

  ([#726](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/726/) and
  [#659](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/659/))

* Removes a warning about missing *break* before *default* when *default*
  is the first switch statement ([#490](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/490/)):

      switch (name) {
      default: // No warning here
        doSomething();
        break;
      case "JSHint":
        doSomethingElse();
      }

* Improves support for [future reserved keywords](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Reserved_Words#Words_reserved_for_possible_future_use).
  JSHint now properly recognizes future reserved keywords both for ES3 and ES5
  environments with their corresponding rules.
  ([#674](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/674/))

* Changes behavior for *hasOwnProperty* ([#770](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/770/)):

      var hasOwnProperty = ...; // No warning
      var obj = { hasOwnProperty: ... }; // Warning
      obj.hasOwnProperty = ...; // Warning
      obj['hasOwnProperty'] = ...; // Warning

* Adds ability to disable option *unused* per function!
  ([#639](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/639/))

      // jshint unused:true
      var a; // Warning

      function foo(b) { // No warning
        // jshint unused:false
        return 1;
      }

      foo();

Bug fixes:

* Adds *scope* property to critical errors. ([#714](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/714/))
* Fixes a regression bug with option *predef* making all global variables
  writeable. ([#665](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/665/))
* Fixes a bug with JSHint not warning about potential typos on `return o.a = 1`.
  ([#670](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/670/))
* Fixes a bug with *implied* property containing false positive data when
  option *undef* is off.
  ([#668](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/668/))


#### CLI

* This version **removes support for the JavaScriptCore shell** due to its
  limited API. Note that this doesn't mean that JSHint no longer works in
  Safari, it simply means that we removed the ability to use jshint via the command
  line JSC shell.

* This version also **removes support for Windows Script Host**. WSH support
  was initially added due to Node not working well on Windows but, thanks to
  Microsoft engineers, this is no longer true. So everyone is encouraged to
  use JSHint with Node.

* This version relies on ES5 syntax, so if you use JSHint with
  Rhino, please make sure you have the latest version: 1.7R4.

This version includes several improvements to the Node version of JSHint:

* Adds a new flag, `--verbose`, that changes output to display message codes:

      $ jshint --verbose my.js
      my.js: line 7, col 23, Extra comma. (...) (W070)

* Makes `--config` raise an error if it can't find provided file or if the
  file is invalid JSON.
  ([#691](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/691/))

Bug fixes:

* Fixes a bug with `.jshintignore` globbing not working properly.
  ([#777](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/777/) and
  [#692](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/692/))

* Fixes a bug with JSHint skipping over files with no extensions.
  ([#690](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/690/))


#### What's next?

I plan to test this release candidate for about a week before marking it
as stable and publishing on NPM. And, at the same time, I will be updating the
documentation and the [jshint.com](http://jshint.com/) website. If you notice any
bugs or unexpected backwards-incompatible changes, please file a bug.

**RC3 is out:** [JSHint 1.0.0 RC3](http://jshint.com/blog/2013-01-01/1-0-0-rc3/).

Here's how you can install this release candidate:

    $ npm install https://github.com/jshint/jshint/archive/1.0.0-rc1.tar.gz

For Rhino wrapper, you will need to clone our repo and build jshint-rhino:

    $ node make.js build
    $ rhino dist/jshint-rhino.js ...
